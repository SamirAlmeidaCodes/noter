# noter

Noter is a personal project made with the main objective of creating a note taking web app that suits my (Samir Almeida) needs, both on the phone and computer.

If you wish to use this or to take it as a base for your own note taking app or other project you can as long as respecting the license.

This project also did help me developing my front-end skills as my main strengths are back-end.

To use this project as it is you can take the build folder and upload it to your server to use it everywhere.

If you wish to change it, you can take the code that is in the repository, and respecting the license, you can change it as you wish.
